<!--Good to know that if using Areas and tagHelpers dont work or not loading Layout properly 
    add  Layout = "~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml"; in top of view. 
    And for Tag helpers add this file in the View in area :) 
    U can also includa _ViewStart as this file and it will load the layout :)
